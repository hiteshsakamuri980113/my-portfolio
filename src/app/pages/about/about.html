          <p class="lead">
            I'm a software engineer with 5 years of experience, where I worked
            on building web applications for companies like Aflac and Disney. I
            enjoy building things with code and learning new technologies along
            the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of my experience has been with Angular, TypeScript, and
            JavaScript on the frontend, and I've also worked with Node.js, Java,
            and databases like MySQL. In my free time, I've been learning Python
            and exploring AI technologies like Google ADK and FastMCP to build
            personal projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            Right now I'm studying Software Engineering Technology at Centennial
            College to keep learning and stay current with new technologies. I
            like solving problems and building applications that actually work
            well for users.
